Friday Lead

Hello everyone, my name is still Evan and I'm still an alcoholic. Thank you for giving me the chance to share my experience, strength and hope to inspire others.

I would like to welcome the newcomers _____, give yourself huge credit and a pat on the back for taking action during these times. I mean seriously, this year has been the best excuse to isolate and numb yourself. Also to _____ for your x years, I hope you keep investing time into your recovery because the returns are worth it!

So you all might think that I’m here today to tell you that after 8 months clean and sober that my life is better than ever. Well it’s not. Im still delusional most days and have an occasional dumpster fire. But you know what, I’m getting 1% stronger everyday.

A little back story on me is that I grew up with an inflated ego from sports. It was my identity and how I was validated from my peers. A midseason injury set me back and I wasn’t in the spotlight anymore. To fill that void, I starting engaging in risky behaviors to get validation. Instead of hitting the game winning shot, I was now the guy to run out of grocery store with a shopping cart full of booze for the after party. My new way of giving someone an alley oop was hooking them up with drugs.

This negative feedback loop continued for the next 10 years that included dropping out of school multiple times, not being able to hold down a job or intimate relationship. Man was I fooled by drugs and alcohol. At first it only took a little bit to feel good. I became the confident person I always wanted to be. Soon, I had to take more and more just to feel the same effect. It quickly became a different substance for everyday of the week. Not even to feel high anymore, just not to feel like shit.

At the start of this year, I was sleeping out of my car off Cass St. in PB, unable to get thru the day without getting loaded. The phone was heavy but I called my brother to helped drive me to a treatment center where I was introduced to my first meetings. At first I thought you guys were going to teach me moderation and how to use like a normal person. But what you really taught me was rigorous honesty. That my fears, resentments and self-seeking motives were the cause of my misery and that there was a solution. To admit to myself, another human being and a higher power the exact nature of my wrongs.

Having just finished working the 12 steps with a sponsor Matty D, I now treat my recovery like I treat my car. I have to do regular maintenance so my life doesn’t blow up and I get stranded on the side of the road. The best way for me to stay clean and sober is by helping a fellow alcoholic or addict. I’m open to new sponsorship so if you need help of any kind, please reach out in the chat box at the end meeting.

Next, I would like to share 3 things to newcomers that I wish I knew when I first started. If you don’t remember anything else from this meeting today, just remember these 3 things.

Keep an open mind because something good might fall in. If the word “God” bothers you like it did for me, use this group’s support as your higher power. Your sponsor benefits from working the steps as much as you do. Don’t feel a burden. Last, is a short reading on today’s topic from p. 30 in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.

Most of us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No person likes to think he or she is mentally different from their fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday we could control and enjoy our drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.

You know that passage is very important to me. It helped break my denial as a problem drinker. For years I thought I could control it but 1 was never enough and 1000 was too many.

I would like to move on and call on people to share. Please keep it to 3 minutes or less.

_____ would you like to share on your experience on the 1st step of breaking denial and admitting you had a problem?
